# `soroban-scan-core` public API stability

Consumers embedding the scanner may rely on the **stable** surface below.
Everything else is **unstable** and may change in any release.

## Stable

- `engine` entry points for scanning source, manifests, and loaded projects.
- `config` (`ScanConfig`, rule selection, thresholds, excludes, suppressions).
- `finding`, `model`, `severity`, `confidence`, and `category` value types.
- `report` renderers and output format parsing.
- `rule`, `registry`, and `validation` extension points for custom rules.

Breaking changes to these items require a major version bump. Additive changes
may ship in minor releases. The stable surface is listed in `lib.rs` rustdoc and
is enforced by the `api_stability` integration test.

## Unstable

- `source`, `project`, `discovery`, `manifest`, `suppression`, `soroban`, and
  `rules` internals.
- `ai`, `baseline`, `context`, and `error` support modules.
- The `analysis`/pipeline implementation details and any `pub(crate)` item.
- Internal utility modules (`rules::util`, `test_support`).

These may be refactored without a major bump. They are public only to support
the scanner's own crates and tests; downstream code should not depend on them.

## Enforcement

The `api_stability` test checks that every top-level `pub mod` is classified in
this document as stable or unstable, and that stable modules remain documented.
